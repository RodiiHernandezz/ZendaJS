The Packages folder contains the native or custom packages of your project.

You can use import shortcuts that were designed to work with packages, and save 
yourself the trouble of typing 'Packages / <PackageName> /' each time to perform an import.

 => import * as Test from 'PackageName/Index.js'

Remember that there are different ways to import modules, you choose 
how to work and the use that you will give to this powerful functionality.

ZendaJS is in a BETA version, it is possible that there are no packages 
available to use and/or if they do exist they are not stable.

Happy Hacking and remember drink water!
